array_flip -- Exchanges all keys with their associated values in an array

  array array_flip(array array)~

|array_flip| returns an array in flip order, i.e. keys from {array} become
values and values from {array} become keys.

Note that the values of {array} need to be valid keys, i.e. they need to be
either integer or string. A warning will be emitted if a value has the wrong
type, and the key/value pair in question will not be included in the result.

If a value has several occurrences, the latest key will be used as its value,
and all others will be lost.

{array} An array of key/value pairs to be flipped.

Returns the flipped array on success and NULL on failure.

<?php >
  $trans = array_flip($trans);

<?php >
  $trans = array("a" => 1, "b" => 1, "c" => 2);
  $trans = array_flip($trans);
  print_r($trans);
?>

  Array

      [1] => b
      [2] => c
  )
